# Project Overview
This project is a practical exploration designed to enhance understanding of machine learning fundamentals, focusing on image classification techniques using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Experimented with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (MLP Classifier), applying various preprocessing methods to observe their impact on model performance. The primary goals were to understand:

1. How different preprocessing techniques affect classification accuracy.
2. The performance of different classifiers on image-based data.

# Dataset: Fashion MNIST
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 clothing categories, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.
Categories: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
